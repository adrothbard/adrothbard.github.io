      <p>The function of a PWA is to provide the user with an UI/UX interaction that feels like a traditional app, but instead using a web browser. This app can be installed on the users desktop via a browser, and although this page is a simple device to change the backgroudn image, there are much more robust programming options availble to be deployed using this method.  In order to accomplish this taks we need to add a web app manifest file and a service worker.</p>

      <p>Here a JSON manifest file has been created for a basic PWA so the user will be able to see the option to install the application when using the menu of the browser - see the image shown here when a web application with PWA features when presented in the Chrome browser, shows and instal option in the menu of the browser. The user will also see the icon to download the application in the navigation bar of the browser.</p>

 <p>We can use a service worker JavaScript file to help build our PWA, but also services workers can also be employed for background tasks, such as provided continuity for the user if an Internect connection is cut off.</p>

 <button id="btn-2">Light Blue</button>
       
        <p>Above are two buttons that allow the user to change the background image of this page.  What the user many not not is that the developer has also installed a Service Worker JavaScript that opens the caches object with the name that was given in the variable CACHE_VERSION.  Viewing the Cache Storage in Chrome Developer tools indicates all of the elements availble to the user even when browsing offline.</p>
